    <th>Day</th>
    <th>What I Did</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Monday</td>
    <td>I wasn't aware that it was going to be break and that my family was going to be on a whole day trip. They took me along too! I'm going to be a day behind now.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tuesday</td>
    <td>I did create the review ticket and I added a few things that I need to do and already completed. I reviewed how to get my website up and running.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wednesday</td>
    <td>I eventually found a JavaScript grab of a Click Speed Test. I looked through the code for a bit and I added and changed colors around. I created a bash script to demonstrate the tools. I'm a day ahead.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Thursday</td>
    <td>I asked ChatGPT to explain bash to me so I could better understand it. I also created a wikipedia search page and completed it. I grabbed the grade calculator from the teacher repository and looked through and reviewed the code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Friday</td>
    <td>I looked through my older code to see if I needed to fix anything. Most of everything looked fine. I decided that over the weekend I would try to figure out how to create a code for option 2 in the peer review requirements.</td>
    <td>Saturday</td>
    <td>I figured out that I don't think I can encorperate different languages together. I think I might have to go with option 1.</td>
    <td>Sunday</td>
    <td>I created the cat class code and the cat table code. The Cat Table allows users to put in cats into a table with information they put in, like their age, name, location, etc.</td>
