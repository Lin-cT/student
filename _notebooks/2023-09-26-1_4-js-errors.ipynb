    "I changed/added the alphabet list code from the previous cell. I then changed the code in the for statement. Originally, it was comparing i, an intiger, to string (alphabet list). If you add .length, it changes it to the length of the alphabet list which is 27 letters long. Then I subtracted 1 from letter number since arrays assign numbers to letters starting from 0 (this way we would actually get the 4th letter in the array but when you count starting from one it would be the 5th letter in the array). In order to print the actual letter from the array, I had to change the consol.log() statement as well. Instead of just printing the letter number which would just print out 5, we have to print out the 5th letter in the array, alphabetList. So we set alphabetList[] parameters to letterNumber - 1 in order to get the letter we want. "
